ABOUT VIEWS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, when we change the name of views to TEMPLATES --> WE can no longer access the folder again, 
The nodejs code looks for views in the default location, but once it cannot find it, it displays error
To fix this we need to set a path so that it functions smoothly
views is looked for by default, we have changed it to Templates for proper functioning
