        <p><strong>Welcome to this website.</strong><br>
        This is a webapp project, done by Shoaib Bhutia.<br>
        The main purpose of this project is to get a location from the user and display the weather forecast, full location information of the searched location.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This has been created/desgined by using plain javascript,node.js, HTML, CSS and slight touch of Bootstrap.<br>
            The main purpose of this website was for educational purpose, to learn about back-end interaction of node.js with the browser.<br>
            This web-app is mainly focused on back-end work (mainly node.js), where we dealt with modern features like - 
            <ul>
                <li>Asynchronous javascript - Callback Function/Abstraction/Chaining, etc.</li>
                <li>Web-Server - Static Assets, Dynamic Pages with Templating, etc.</li>
                <li>API Acessing from Browser - Query String, Default Function Parameter</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This uses two APIs, Position Stack to convert the inputted location to it's respective co-ordinates, and Weather Stack, to display/forcast the weather of the provided co-ordinates. The interaction of APIs has been the main focus of this project.
            <br>Lastly, the course followed to build this is, Andrew Mead's Nodejs Course(Udemy) which is very good to get started with node.js</br>
