ABOUT Handlebars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get a thing that's dynamic on our page in every subpages, including the index.html, we use npm i hbs
Handle bars let us do the task easily
Handlebars (hbs) gives us more flexibility in designing our html page, we can use {{title}} in all our webpages to give 
it a similar vibe hence we can see reuseability here which is not quite good but comparitevly better than previous html models

ABOUT Partials with Handlebars
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are templates or parts of webpages which we keep on reusing on every page for a unified feeling
